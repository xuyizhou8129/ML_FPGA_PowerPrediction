***Use compiler-estimated execution cost and predicted hardware footprint to predict total power consumption***

Independent Variables:
hls_synth__latency_best_cycles
hls_synth__latency_average_cycles
hls_synth__latency_worst_cycles

hls_synth__resources_lut_used: 
Lookup Tables as a fundamental hardware resource within a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)

hls_synth__resources_ff_used:
Number of flip-flops used

hls_synth__resources_dsp_used:
Number of DSP blocks used (dedicated arithmetic units in the FPGA)
dominates dynamic power

hls_synth__resources_bram_used:
Number of Block RAM used
(on-chip SRAM blocks
usually 18Kb or 36Kb
used for arrays, buffers, FIFOs, and caches)


Number of UltraRAM blocks estimated by HLS.
(URAM is:
a newer large memory primitive on UltraScale+ FPGAs
used when arrays are very large)

Dependent Variable:
